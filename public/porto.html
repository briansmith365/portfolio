<!-- short bio -->
<p id="bio">Brian is a Marine Corps veteran that not only served during the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom but after getting out of the Marine Corps he continued to serve his country on the civilian side. He started contracting with KBR services for several years and when the contracts changed hands he switched over to the winners, Dyn-Corp International. During his time in the Marine Corps he was a Heavy Equipment Operator(H.E.) and he was a Primary Marksmanship Instructor while stationed in Okinawa, Japan. Some soft skills picked up during his time in the military are attention to detail, integrity, team leadership, problem solving, critical thinking and being a dependable team player. These skills played a very important role in supervising his team when operating cranes. Every time he went out on a project he would be honing his supervisor skills that would eventually land him a supervisory role as a foreman for the project in Kuwait. During Brian’s time working in the middle east he would vacation in Thailand which he fell in love with and discovered SCUBA diving. Brian has become a tec-50 diver to which he can dive down to 50 meters (164ft) and he can perform accelerated decompression so speed up the decompression process. The amount of planning that goes into a tec dive requires a great attention to detail to be able to stay alive. Brian has been self teaching some basic web development and learning the basics of c++ programming but felt that it was at to slow a pace and decided to join a coding bootcamp and found Wyncode in Miami Florida to which he throughly enjoys attending.</p>
